# Julianna Vishnyakova's First CS193 Homework
## Things I Love About CS193:
- The Instructors!
- The fact that it will prepare me for (already difficult) CS courses later in college
- That we will cover topics such as interviews, tracks & degree plans from people who have personal experience and input on all of those things!
